# 0️⃣.0️⃣ Zero_Point_Zero 🤟

Welcome to my very first Python project! 🎉 This humble calculator may not be the fanciest tool in the shed, but it's packed with heart, determination, and a whole lot of trial and error. Join me on a journey back to the early days of my coding adventures as I share the story behind this simple yet significant project.

- **🗺️ A Journey of Discovery:** When I first dipped my toes into the vast ocean of Python programming, I was a complete newbie with big dreams and a whole lot to learn. Little did I know, this calculator would be the cornerstone of my coding journey—a testament to my passion for problem-solving and creative expression.

- **🔁 The Copy-Paste Chronicles:** Ah, the days before Git and GitHub! Armed with nothing but my trusty text editor and an insatiable curiosity, I embarked on a quest to create the perfect calculator. *With each iteration, I copy-pasted my code into this file, tweaking, tinkering, and testing until I achieved a result that left me satisfied.*

## 🛠️ Main Technologies

- Just `Python 3.x`


## 🚦 Running the Project

To run the project in your local environment,Python must be installed on your system and follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `py zero_point_zero.py` in terminal or click on run `▶️` button to get the project started.

## 🕹️ How to Use

1. **👩🏻‍💻 Fire up the Terminal:** Prepare to step into the world of Python magic as you launch the calculator in your trusty terminal.

2. **🔣 Enter Your Equation:** Type your equation using the provided syntax, such as `last_num + 5` or `last_num / 5`, and watch as the calculator works its magic.

3. **🌍 Explore and Experiment:** Feel free to experiment with different operators and numbers, testing the limits of the calculator and uncovering its hidden powers.

4. **❌ Quit with a Q:** When you're ready to bid farewell to the calculator, simply type 'q' to exit gracefully and return to the real world.

## 🦄 Features

- **🚀 Test 6: Less Code, More Function:** Test 6 was a turning point in the evolution of my calculator. Fueled by a desire for efficiency and elegance, I embraced the philosophy of "less is more," streamlining my code while maximizing functionality.

- **🤗 Terminal UI Improvements:** Who says terminal apps have to be boring? I poured my heart and soul into improving the user experience, adding interactive elements and intuitive prompts to elevate the calculator from a mere tool to a delightful experience.

- **🤹🏻 Handling Known Exceptions:** From SyntaxErrors to ZeroDivisionErrors, I faced my fair share of challenges along the way. But with each error came an opportunity to learn, grow, and become a better programmer.

## 🤳🏼 Reflections

- **🆕 From Humble Beginnings:** What started as a simple project has blossomed into a symbol of my journey as a coder—an emblem of perseverance, creativity, and the joy of discovery.

- **🎯 Learning by Doing:** This project taught me more than just Python syntax; it taught me the value of patience, persistence, and the power of passion to drive progress.

- **🚩The Beginning of an Adventure:** As I look back on my first foray into Python programming, I can't help but feel excited for the adventures that lie ahead. With each line of code, I'm one step closer to realizing my dreams and making a difference in the world of technology.

## 🤔 How Can It Be Improved?

**Limited Functionality**: The calculator currently supports basic arithmetic operations. Adding support for more complex operations or functions could make it more versatile and useful for a wider range of users.

## 🐛 Current Bug

So far, I'm not really sure if there are any bugs. However, there might be some issues. I tested it out on my computer (Windows 10), and so far it looks good there.

## 🚀 Let's Get Started

So, grab your virtual calculator and join me on this journey of exploration and discovery. Who knows what wonders await as we crunch numbers, solve equations, and embrace the thrill of coding creativity!
